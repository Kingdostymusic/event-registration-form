Event Registration Form
A contact form is a web-based tool that allows users to communicate directly with the owner or administrator of a website or application. It serves as a bridge between users and the organization or individual behind the website, enabling them to send messages, ask questions, provide feedback, or make inquiries without needing to use external email software.
